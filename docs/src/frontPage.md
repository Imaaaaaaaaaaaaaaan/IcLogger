# What is ILog?

ILog is a library that makes logging and assertion quick and easy.
ILog is a simple library that is beginner friendly.

Also note that if your compiler doesn't automatically define ```NDEBUG``` when compiling with optomization on, please define this as ILog depeneds on this define to know when you are not compiling in debug mode. 

Code example:
```c
#include <ILog.h>

int main() 
{
    I_LOG_ERROR("Something Happened!");
    // This will only run in unoptimized builds
    I_DEBUG_LOG_ERROR("Another Thing Happened!");

    return 0;
}
```

Console output:
